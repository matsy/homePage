<h2> Why? </h2>
<p> I have been thinking of having a personal webpage that would act as an interface for the users to connect with me at the same get an idea of some of the projects I did. </p>

<p>Surfing over web for possible options, I found Github Pages and it's free. That's an added advantage. </p>

<h2> How? </h2>
<p>
Following are the steps I followed for creating this Github Page.
First, I headed over to the GitHub Pages https://docs.github.com/en/pages documentation and followed the mentioned steps to create the website.
Second, I surfed the web for a bootstrap template that would serve my purpose and found the following template appealing https://startbootstrap.com/theme/grayscale
I modified their code to serve my purpose. pushed the code to the repository and saved the content to publish it to the GitHub Page.
